            <h2>Health</h2><br>
            <p>If you have a health condition, or you are pregnant, you may need specialist healthcare abroad. Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have appropriate travel insurance for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.</p><br>
            <p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.</p><br>
            <p>General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.</p><br>

            <h2 class="imn">Health care</h2><br>
            <p class="imn">You should get a free UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. If you already have an EHIC it will still be valid as long as it remains in date.</p><br>
            <p  class="imn">The GHIC or EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Danish nationals. If you don’t have your EHIC with you or you’ve lost it, you can call the NHS Overseas Healthcare Team on +44 191 218 1999 to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.</p><br>
            <p  class="imn">It’s important to take out appropriate travel insurance for your needs. A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both before you travel. It does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment. Read more about what your travel insurance should cover.</p><br>
            <p  class="imn">UK prescriptions are not recognised in Denmark. If you need medication while travelling you should speak to a local pharmacist, who will be able to tell you if you need a prescription from a local GP. </p><br>

                <h2  class="imn">Crime</h2><br>
                <p  class="imn">Crime levels are generally low, but pickpockets and bag-snatchers operate in crowded areas mainly around Copenhagen.<br><br>

                    Be aware that thieves can use a variety of methods to distract you, particularly when getting on and off from crowded public transport. Thieves are also known to operate opportunistically around hotel lobby areas and in cafes and restaurants.<br><br>
                    
                    Keep your personal belongings, including passports and money secure. You should also keep an eye on luggage, including in the overhead baggage compartment when travelling on trains to and from the airport.<br><br>
                    
                    This kind of crime is more common at the central station, Nørreport Station and on the main shopping street called Strøget and other areas popular with tourists such as Christiania, Nyhavn and Kongens Nytorv. Pickpockets are also known to operate inside Kastrup airport.<br><br>
                    
                    You should take extra care in Christiania and Nørrebro, particularly late at night. There have been some instances of gang violence in these areas.</p>

                <h2  class="imn">driving regulations</h2><br>
                <p>Always wear seatbelts.<br><br>

                    You must drive with dipped headlights at all times and they should be masked with special European opaque material available from most garages in the UK and Ireland. It is now law in Denmark to indicate before changing lanes on a motorway. You should carry a warning triangle in case of breakdowns.<br><br>
                    
                    Sanctions for speeding have become tougher. Those caught driving 100km/h in a 50km/h zone or past road works with a 50km/h restriction may immediately lose their licence.<br><br>
                    
                    You must give due consideration to the many cyclists present in Danish cities. Cyclists often have the right of way. It is particularly important that you check cycle lanes before turning right. See the European Commission, AA and RAC guides on driving in Denmark.</p>
